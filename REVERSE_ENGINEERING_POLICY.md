# PrjXylene Reverse-engineering Policy

It is **extremely** important to ensure that all source code, documentation, and any other contributions to prjxylene as well as everything else produced by the project be in good legal standing, and free from any copyright, intellectual property violations, and all other potential legal problems. As such, in order to ensure this, the following policies have been put into place.

At no point should anyone contributing to prjxylene incorporate data or code that can only be found by disassembling, decompiling, or decoding anything to do with any Xilinx tools or Xilinx data files. Even if said files are in plain text and not encoded. Doing so puts the project in jeopardy.

The only information that should be included is things that can be extracted by any end user via given interfaces, and/or fuzzed by the tooling.

As the project develops so too will this policy, so ensure to check it for updates.
